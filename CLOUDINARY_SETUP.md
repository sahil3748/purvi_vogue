# üîê Cloudinary Secure Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to securely configure Cloudinary for image uploads in the Purvi Vogue Flutter application.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice
**NEVER commit API keys or secrets to version control!** The current implementation uses unsigned uploads, which is the secure approach for client-side applications.

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your Cloudinary Cloud Name
1. Log in to your [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. Your cloud name is displayed in the top-left corner of the dashboard
3. It looks like: `dxxxxx` or `your-company-name`

### 2. Create an Upload Preset
1. In your Cloudinary Dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Upload**
2. Scroll down to **Upload presets**
3. Click **Add upload preset**
4. Configure the preset:
   - **Preset name**: Choose a name (e.g., `purvi_vogue_uploads`)
   - **Signing Mode**: Select **Unsigned** (this is crucial for security)
   - **Folder**: Set to `purvi_vogue/products` (optional)
   - **Allowed formats**: Select image formats you want to allow
   - **Max file size**: Set appropriate limit (e.g., 10MB)
5. Click **Save**

### 3. Configure the Application

#### Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended for Production)
Create a `.env` file in your project root (this file is already in .gitignore):

```bash
# .env file
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset_name_here
```

Then run the app with:
```bash
flutter run --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset_name_here
```

#### Option B: Direct Configuration (Development Only)
For development, you can temporarily update `lib/config/env_config.dart`:

```dart
static const String cloudinaryCloudName = String.fromEnvironment(
  'CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME',
  defaultValue: 'your_actual_cloud_name', // Replace with your cloud name
);

static const String cloudinaryUploadPreset = String.fromEnvironment(
  'CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET',
  defaultValue: 'your_actual_upload_preset', // Replace with your upload preset
);
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to revert this before committing to version control!**

### 4. Test the Configuration
1. Run the application
2. Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Add Product
3. Try uploading an image
4. Check if the image appears in your Cloudinary media library

## üîí Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ What's Secure (Current Implementation)
- **Unsigned uploads**: Uses upload presets instead of API keys
- **Client-side only**: No server-side code needed
- **Environment variables**: Credentials not hardcoded
- **Gitignore protection**: Sensitive files excluded from version control

### ‚ùå What to Avoid
- Never use API keys in client-side code
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Don't use signed uploads for client applications
- Avoid hardcoding cloud names in source code

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Upload preset not found"**
   - Check that the upload preset name is correct
   - Ensure the preset is set to "Unsigned" mode
   - Verify the preset is active

2. **"Cloud name not found"**
   - Double-check your cloud name in the Cloudinary dashboard
   - Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters

3. **"Upload failed"**
   - Check file size limits in your upload preset
   - Verify allowed file formats
   - Check network connectivity

### Debug Mode
To debug upload issues, check the console logs when uploading images. The Cloudinary service will show detailed error messages.

## üì± Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Use environment variables** for all credentials
2. **Set up proper CORS** in your Cloudinary settings
3. **Configure upload presets** with appropriate restrictions
4. **Monitor usage** through Cloudinary dashboard
5. **Set up backup** and recovery procedures

## üîÑ Updating Configuration

To update Cloudinary settings:

1. Modify the upload preset in Cloudinary dashboard
2. Update environment variables if needed
3. Test thoroughly before deploying
4. Monitor for any issues after deployment

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Cloudinary documentation
2. Review error messages in console
3. Verify configuration settings
4. Test with a simple image upload

**Remember**: Security is paramount. Always use unsigned uploads and never expose API keys in client-side applications!
